//#region DEFINITION

/**
 * @definition
 * A graph data structure consists of finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points,
 * together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for a unidirected graph or a set of ordered pairs
 * for a directed graph.
 *
 * In simple terms:
 *
 *          Nodes
 *          +
 *          Connections 🔂
 *
 * @example
 *
 *                            A
 *                       ↗        ↖
 *                      B           E
 *                      |           |
 *                      C           F
 *                       ↖       ↗
 *                            D

 *
 * Uses for Graphs:
 *  ✳ Social Networks
 *  ✳ Location / Mapping
 *  ✳ Routing Algorithms

 * ✳  Edge - connection between nodes
 * ✳  Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices.
 * ✳  Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distances between vertices.

 *
 * In an undirected graph there is no direction/polarity between the edges (e.g. A ↔ B can go from A to B or B to A)
 * In a directed graph there is a direction/polarity between the edges (e.g. A ➡  B can go from A to B not from B toA)
 *
 * If there is a value assocated with a edge then it is a weighted graph
