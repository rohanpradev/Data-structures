	/**
	 * DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
	 * The Approach:
	 *
	 *      üî≤ Every time we look o visit a new node,
	 *          we pick the node with smallest known distance to visit
	 *
	 *      üî≤ Once we've moved to the node we're going to visit,
	 *          we look at each of its neighbours.
	 *
	 *      üî≤ For each neighbouring node, we calculate the distance by summing total edges
	 *          that lead to that node we're checking from the starting node
	 *
	 *      üî≤ If the new distance to a node is less than the previous total,
	 *          we store the new shorter distance for that node.
	 *
	 * @pseudocode
	 * The function shouldaccept a starting and ending vertex.
	 * Create an object (we'll call it distances) and set each key to be every vertex in
	 *   the adjacency list with a value of infinity except for the starting vertex,
	 *   which should have a value of 0.
	 * After setting the value in the distances object, add each vertex with a priority of Infinity
	 *   to the priority queue, except for the starting vertex, which should have a value of 0,
	 *   because thats where we begin.
	 * Create another object called previous and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list
	 *   with a value of null
	 * Start looping as long as there is anything in the priority queue:
	 *
	 *      üî≤ Dequeue a vertex from the priority queue.
	 *      üî≤ If that vertex is same as the ending vertex - we are done!
	 *      üî≤ Otherwise loop through each value in the adjacency list at that vertex
	 *
	 *            üî≥ Calculate distance to that vertex from the strating vertex
	 *            üî≥ If the distance is less than what is currently being stored in our distances object
	 *                üí† update the distances object with new lower distance
	 *                üí† update the previous object to contain that vertex
	 *                üí† enqueue the vertex with total distance from the start node
